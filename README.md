# Klang Playground

The Klang Playground is a web-based platform designed for simplicity, allowing users to run Klang code directly in their web browsers without the need to install the compiler. The site is currently not deployed or hosted.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Write your Klang code in the editor on the left side of the screen.
3. Click the "Run" button to execute the code.
4. View the output of your code in the "Output" section on the right side of the screen.

## Example

The playground includes a sample Klang code that demonstrates selection sort and binary search algorithms. You can load this example by clicking the "Example" button.
